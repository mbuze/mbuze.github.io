      <description>Atomistic fracture  One of my main research interests concerns developing a mathematically rigorous theory of fracture starting from the atomistic scale. The term fracture refers to a separation of a material into two or more pieces by means of a thin opening, a crack, propagating through it due to the accumulation of stress. Cracks are abundant in human-built structures and are, for instance, a common sight in the walls of ageing buildings, as seen to the right in the a photo of a crack in the wall of my student accomodation at Warwick.</description>
